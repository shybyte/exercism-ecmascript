# Ocr Numbers

Write a program that, given a 3 x 4 grid of pipes, underscores, and spaces, can determine which number is represented, or whether it is garbled.

## Step 1

A simple binary font has been constructed using only pipes and
underscores.

The number is four rows high, three columns wide:

     _   #
    | |  # zero.
    |_|  #
         # the fourth row is always blank

         #
      |  # one.
      |  #
         # (blank fourth row)

Write a program that, given a 3 x 4 grid of pipes, underscores, and
spaces, can determine whether the the grid represents a zero, a one, or
garble.

Anything else is considered garble, and can be represented with a '?'

## Step 2

A simple numeric font has been constructed using only pipes and
underscores.

The number consists of four rows high, three columns wide:

      _  _     _  _  _  _  _  _  #
    | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|| | # decimal numbers.
    ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _||_| #
                                 # fourth line is always blank

There may be several numbers in the input text, one per line.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for ECMAScript to
install the necessary dependencies:

http://exercism.io/languages/ecmascript

## Requirements

They are already described in the link above, but just as a
quick reference:

Install globally a tool to run [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) if
it is not installed yet:

```bash
$ npm install -g gulp-cli
```

Install assignment dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ gulp test
```

In many test suites all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
changing `xit` to `it`.
