# Custom Set

Create a custom set type.

Sometimes it is necessary to define a custom data structure of some
type, like a set. In this exercise you will define your own set. How it
works internally doesn't matter, as long as it behaves like a set of
unique elements.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for ECMAScript to
install the necessary dependencies:

## Requirements

They are already described in the link above, but just as a
quick reference:

Install globally a tool to run [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) if
it is not installed yet:

```bash
$ npm install -g gulp-cli
```

Install assignment dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ gulp test
```

In many test suites all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
changing `xit` to `it`.
